# ORIENTATION-AND-2D-SPIRIT-LEVEL
This project uses the MPU9150 sensor, a 9-axis motion tracking device, to create a 2D digital spirit level by measuring pitch and roll angles through acceleration data. The MPU9150’s accelerometer detects acceleration along three axes (x, y, and z), enabling us to determine the sensor’s orientation relative to gravity.
